# Portfolio Website

This repository contains a personal portfolio built with static HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It includes dedicated pages for a hero-driven home, about, projects, achievements, blog, resume, and contact.

## Development

The site is completely static and can be viewed by opening `index.html` or any of the other HTML files in a browser.
